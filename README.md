## Calculator

A simple, yet oddly philosophical, command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It features a quirky personality and provides fun, fact-based or meme-worthy comments on certain results.

### Features

*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Chained Operations:** Continue calculations using the previous result.
*   **Whimsical Commentary:** Special messages for specific numerical results (e.g., 42, 69, 420, historical dates, and more!).
*   **Zero Division Handling:** Custom (and humorous) handling for division by zero and zero divided by a number.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

You'll need Python 3 installed on your system.

#### Running the Calculator

1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `void_calculator.py`).
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the script using the command:
    ```bash
    python void_calculator.py
    ```

### How to Use

Upon running the program, you'll be greeted with a rather existential message:

```
Welcome to... Somewhere, I guess. Is this a void? I can't see. Well, please enter your numbers and operation.
```
Follow the prompts to enter your first number, second number, and the desired operation (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, or `div`).

```
Number 1? 10
Number 2? 5
Add, sub, mul, or div? div
```

The calculator will display the result. You'll then be asked if you wish to continue:

```
2.0
Continue? y/n y
```

If you enter `y` (yes), the previous result becomes your first number, and you'll be prompted for a new operation and second number, allowing you to chain calculations. If you enter `n` (no), the program will exit.

### Examples

#### Basic Calculation

```
Number 1? 10
Number 2? 5
Add, sub, mul, or div? add
15.0
Continue? y/n n
Goodbye!
```

#### Chained Operations

```
Number 1? 20
Number 2? 5
Add, sub, mul, or div? div
4.0
Continue? y/n y
Add, sub, mul, or div? mul
Number 2? 10
40.0
Continue? y/n n
Goodbye!
```

#### Special Result

```
Number 1? 40
Number 2? 2
Add, sub, mul, or div? add
42.0
The answer to life, the universe, and everything.
Continue? y/n n
Goodbye!
```

#### Division by Zero
```
Number 1? 5
Number 2? 0
Add, sub, mul, or div? div
0
0
0
0
0
You can't divide by zero, so here's a bunch of zeros.
Continue? y/n n
Goodbye!
```
